# homelab
### Hello, and welcome to my homelab repository!

Within this repo, you will find a lot of the configurations I use for my personal homelab,
which I have implemented with the experience I have gained over the years as a DevOps Engineer and
System Admin. 

If you like the content you see, or have any questions about how/why I configured things the
way I did, send me a message on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/austin-thoma-99546594/
